# 3x-ui Xray panel

There is a dedicated 3x-ui installation task: three_x_ui_xray_setup. Stage 1 installs the 3x-ui Xray panel as a system service by wrapping the official installer; it does not manage the panel credentials or create any inbound. Those are stage 2 (panel API control) and stage 3 (universal server inbound) and are documented in the TODO.

## Installation mechanism

The task wraps the official install.sh of the configured repository instead of downloading and unpacking the release itself. The official installer is trusted to resolve the newest release, download and unpack the archive for the architecture into the install directory, create the systemd unit, enable and start the service and install its dependencies; the task does not duplicate those steps. The single source of truth for the installer location is install_script_url in the task config.

The official installer runs non-interactively: XUI_NONINTERACTIVE=1 replaces every interactive prompt with an environment-variable value or a sane default. Alone among the service-install tasks, 3x-ui does not own a rendered configuration file: the panel stores its own state in a generated SQLite database, so on stage 1 there is nothing for the task to write or diff.

## Version resolution

The newest release tag comes from the GitHub releases API of the configured repository, the endpoint https://api.github.com/repos/{github_repo}/releases/latest. The release is fetched with curl and parsed as JSON; a failed request, unparsable payload or a missing tag_name is a task error. The tag carries a leading v; the version comparison strips it on both sides.

The installed version comes from the x-ui binary in the install directory run with -v: the first dotted version triple in the combined stdout and stderr output. A missing binary, a nonzero exit or a hung query reports the version as not installed, so the task runs the installer.

## Idempotency

The official installer always tears the panel down and rebuilds it: on every run it stops the service, removes the install directory and re-unpacks the archive, then enables and starts the service again. It has no version-equality gate of its own. The task therefore applies the gate itself and only invokes the installer when the target state is not reached.

The target state is reached when the installed version equals the newest release tag and the service is enabled and active. The task then returns a plain done result with changed=False and does not invoke the installer, so a working panel is never torn down on a rerun just to confirm the state.

When the version differs, the service is disabled or inactive, or the task is forced, the task downloads the official installer and runs it, then waits for the service to become active. A version mismatch is the normal-update path: the task updates the panel to the newest release without force mode, because updating a version does not destroy the configured system. Force mode reruns the installer even when the version matches and the service is enabled and active, which is the explicit permission to rebuild the panel.

## Credentials boundary

Stage 1 sets no username, password, port or webBasePath and does not read them. On the first start the panel generates its own random credentials and API token and writes them into /etc/x-ui/install-result.env (mode 600, root). This file is the handoff to stage 2, which logs in through the panel API and stores the credentials in the project vault. On a rerun of the official installer against a panel whose credentials are no longer the defaults, the installer preserves them; only a panel still using default credentials is given fresh random credentials.

## Service lifecycle

The systemd unit is created by the official installer; the task never renders or writes it. After the installer completes, the task waits for the unit to report active, repeating the is-active check up to start_check_attempts times with a pause of start_check_retry_delay_seconds between the attempts. A unit that stays inactive after the loop is a task error.

## Limitations of stage 1

Stage 1 verifies only that the panel binary is installed, the version matches and the service is active. It does not verify that the panel answers over HTTP, because that requires the credentials and the API login, which are stage 2. A service that reports active but fails to serve is not detected on stage 1; stage 2 will catch it through the session check.
